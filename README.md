# Nier-Replicant-Crashing-entire-PC
A little background with what i have done after my game got installed. I installed Radical Replicant Special K mod and a Reshade mod. I created a folders ReshadeShaders2_shaders and textures and put the reshade provided data. As you can see i changed main folder name to 2 as Original Reshade_Shaders is getting used by another game. Now, to the problem itself. The Game runs perfectly with both mods installed no issue. Both are getting detected and working flawlessly. But, as i reach Wave 3 or Wave 8 in between my whole PC closes meaning CPU gets off with my desktop üñ•Ô∏è light blinking. I try to play Again but it does the same GPU crash thing between Waves either pretty early or very late. What have i tried so far ? I reinstalled Nier Replicant and start to play immediately meaning without any mods installed to see if i can get past the crash point but nope. It crashes as usual. I tried Installing Latest Nvidia Gpu Driver... it felt like it got fixed as i come a little far than usual but nope it again crashed. I also turned off Ansel in Nvidia configuration. So, i rest my case with that.. i also attached read me files with crash report i found.
